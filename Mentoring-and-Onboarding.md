# Mentoring and Onboarding

This can be a bit overwhelming to describe to a junior dev, however I like this method of micro front ends because it is so close to the standard front end way of developing. Aside from simply learning more about all the technologies (which can benefit anyone entering a new team), I believe the best way to onboard someone to this arcitechture would be pair programming a walkthrough, pairing on a feature to reinforce normal best practices, and some pairing on a bug for a deep dive into the inner workings of what makes this setup special.
